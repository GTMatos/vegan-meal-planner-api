|----------|------------------------------|
| feat     | New feature                   |
| fix      | Bug fix                       |
| docs     | Documentation only changes    |
| chore    | Changes to build or tooling   |
| refactor | Code change (no behavior change) |
| test     | Adding tests                  |

## üå± Branch Lifecycle

- Always create branches from `main` (do not branch off other feature branches unless needed)
- Use a descriptive branch name (see naming convention above)
- One branch = one logical change (linked to an Issue)
- Once a branch is merged:
    - Do not reuse the branch
    - You may delete the branch after merge (recommended for keeping repo clean)
- For follow-up changes, create a new branch from `main`

---

## üöÄ Pull Request Process

- Create a branch per feature/bugfix
- Follow branch naming convention
- Use clear, descriptive PR titles
- Link PRs to related issues (ex: `Closes #9`)
- Complete PR template checklist
- Squash commits before merge if needed

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Security and Best Practices

- Never commit secrets or credentials
- Keep `/docs/security.md` updated as project evolves
- Enable Dependabot alerts
- Use protected main branch with PRs required

---

## üìö Documentation Standards

- Main project info ‚Üí in `README.md`
- Security practices ‚Üí in `docs/security.md`
- Architecture notes ‚Üí in `docs/architecture.md` (planned)
- Contributing standards ‚Üí in `docs/CONTRIBUTING.md`
